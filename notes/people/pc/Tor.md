![Tor](../../../images/tor.png)

**Race**: Goliath <br />
**Class**: Warlock (Hexblade) <br />
**Factions**:  <br />


**Notes**:
- Carries a black blade.
- Has been cursed by the blade he carries.
    - Murdered his whole village, in some kind of black out rage caused by the blade.
- Finds another (withered orc) who has also been cursed by the blade.
    - The orc believes Tor is to blame for some aspect of the orc's plight, and attacks him.
    - When he dies, a black legged beast springs out of his body. Another tough fight.


- Tor killed Brock and the proprietor of The Cellar in Galmoren after hearing that Grandi was attacked by the Dul'GaraGurahm.
    - Orro discovers this and feels obligated to inform Captain Baylen.
    - Baylen asks the party to leave Galmoren as a result. 

- The morning after the Cellar incident, Tor leaves in the night, leaving only a note:
"Kel,

I have started on a path I cannot abandon. A path I must walk alone. My shining, new armor has already begun to tarnish and rust. That's what I do. Don't rust.

Tor"
