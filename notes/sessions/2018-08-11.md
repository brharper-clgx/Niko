- Gilthur get's a sense of "Desecration" from Orro's pack
    - Orro knows. Probably his Symbol of Moander 

From Matt:
- The bear is afflicted by the same kind of curse as the werewolves etc, but has maintained his sanity.  He introduced himself as Artair and told the party that they should gtfo of the forest.
- The group told him they were traveling to the mountain and he told them that only the dead are brought there now, but that if they insisted he would escort them there, not strictly for their sake, but to preserve calm.  Apparently the party's presence was what set the crazed were-people off.
- Then Orro came out of the pond with the bowl and Artair got pissed, telling him to give it back to him, but because it bears the symbol of Orro's god, he was really resistant
    - Saying that he took it as a sign that he was meant to have it
    - But the party practically screamed at him to give it back after a few minutes of tense staredown
    - and he did, so the bear placed it back in the water and the bowl made its own way back to the pillar it had been resting on.  The group learned through Artair that drinking from the blessed water once a day staves off the madness of the curse, allowing you to keep your former mind
- Uh, bear also had really old looking dwarvish armor on
- So anyway, Triss casts detect magic and finds that the bear has an aura to him, in a curse-y kind of way lol
- And she sees the same emanating from Kel's bite wound
- She asks the bear about it and he's pretty casual, "yeah, he's cursed.  He'll turn at the next full moon."  So the group starts freaking out
- Orro follows a moon god and knows precisely when that is, 15 days, so they believe they have 15 days to save him.
- So they collected a bunch of the water just in case they need it for Kel later
- and the group agrees to be escorted under the care of Altair
