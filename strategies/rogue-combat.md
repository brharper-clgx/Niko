### WHEN THE BATTLE STARTS
1)	Which allies rely on me to do what?
2)	Is if profitable to hide here?
3)	Should I attack straightforwardly, or would a spell be more advantageous?

### CUNNING ACTION
- If the enemy is **far** or **you're retreating**, *Dash*.
- If you have a **hiding spot**, *Hide*.
- If you're in **trouble** or you just used **Booming Blade**, *Disengage*.

### MAGICAL AMBUSH
If you have a decent-to-high Intelligence, you can focus on spells that would otherwise be average for you, and fire away even at resilient foes with them a good chances of success.
