## Library / Research
- [ ] **The Grey Waste:** Specifically, do the documented symptoms match my father's (subtext: was I lied to)?
- [ ] **Ebal Magisterium**: Anything.
- [ ] **Planar Travel:** Specifically, what lied on the other side (any mention of alternative realities or altering the past would particularly peak Niko's interest).

## Communication
- [ ] Find a way to deliver the necklace to Henrietta. Pay extra to keep it confidential. Seal using sealing wax and Niko's signet ring. 
- [ ] Using sending scroll to contact Grahm Stavenger, a blacksmith my father favored and to whom we frequently lent our hands. (Grahm is stoic, gruff, and honest. In Niko's experience Grahm has never been subservient or deferential). Niko's inquires about the state of affairs in Aramoor / Hanrindel. 
  
## Finances 
*Whether Niko does this is dependent on how much currency Niko has left over after shopping and disguise stuff below.*
- Niko tries to find away to consolidate / compress his newly found wealth. Are there banks? 
- If Niko doesn't find a bank or other convenient means to store wealth, he'll track down Beorn and offer to make an investment in his mining company.

## If Princess Muriel Durimere asks us to travel to Maneas
- Who will be in attendence at this council? Which domains will be represented?
- What is expected of us once we are there?
    - If little is expected (i.e., it will be easy to keep a low profile) Niko will not voice dissent.
    - Otherwise, Niko will question what reason the party has to travel across the world? This is not our buisiness. We are not merchants or politicians. And there is much yet to be discovered in Dothombar. 
    - In the end, Niko will got along with the party either way.
- Niko will then seek means (better than disguises self in terms of duration and magical energy cost) to disguise / conceal himself while in Maneas.
