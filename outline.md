- My story is my brother's.
- Born to royal family.
    - I am the second eldest. 
    - My older brother is heir to throne.
- My father, the King, is stoic and stern.
- My mother is sweet and gentle. 
    - [loving memories of her]
    - She fell ill and passed in my fifth year. 
- My brother and I were groomed and educated to one day rule.
    - My brother excelled at his studies:
        - Geography and history
        - Arcana
        - Etiquette
        - Martial arts
    - I was a daydreamer and prankster. 
- Though as different as day and night, my brother and I were inseperable companions. 
    - He would charm the kitchen wench while I snuck sweet cakes from behind her.
    - We competed constantly. Anything could be made into a contest. My brother nearly always proved superior. He was bright, and athletic. But also wise beyond his years. 
- After six years of mourning, my father remaried to [...]. 
    - My brother and I found her to be prude and [up-tight]. But my father seemed more alive than he had in years, and that was enough for us.
    - Soon after my young sister Elise was born.
        - Unlike her mother, she was sweet, curious, and always looking for adventure.
        - He and I became quite close.
- In my fifteenth year there was armed conflict to the [direction] with the [peoples].
    - I was too young to be enlisted, according to my father, who was also too old for the conflict. 
    - But my brother, being nearly twos years my elder, left for battle.
    - He came back some two and half years later a decorated war hero.
- In my brother's abense, and with news of his numerous accomplishments and deeds, I took to my studies and training  with a new intensity, hoping to prove to my father that I was ready to join my brother in the fight.
    - I learned all the names of the Serfdoms, Lords, Ladies, and banners of the rhealm. 
    - I practice the encantations and somatic genstures of the arcane under the castle mage. And although my spells were shabby if not entirely absent, I at least had the rudimentary theory down.
    - But where I really began to shine was in my sword skills. With a short sword in each hand [flavor text; got good yea].
- However, by the time I was of age to join the war, the conflict was nearing its end and my brother was riding back home, victorious.
- My brother was back home. My father was growing older, and he had a worthy successor. All was well in the world.

- Brother gifts me some weapon

- Brother dies. My fault.

- I am now heir. I feel unworthy, guilty. How dare I stand where he stood.

- I leave.

It started with finding ways to undermine my step father, Luther. The state has a monopoly on liquor sales? I'll open an underground distillery. A new law requiring two thirds crop yield go to crown? Let's smuggle food to the common folk. But I must admit, it was more than that. As much as I wanted to do good by the people, and to impede my Luther's tyranny, I took great pleasure in the unlawful. 

By entwining my crimes in noble causes, Rob would overlook my roguish ways. But when he left for war when I was fifteen, fewer and fewer of my shady activities could be seen as causes for the greater good.
