**Race**: Tiefling <br />
**Class**: Sorceress <br />
**Factions**:  <br />


**Notes**:
- Undeadish looking elf woman pursued Hecate in the dead of the night while we stayed in the drunken Pilgrim.
    - After a tough fight, the crew manages to kill her.
    - Claimed Hecate had taken something that wasn't hers 22(?) years ago.
    - Hecate died 22(?) years ago, but someone brought her back to life (from the afterlife).
    - Hecate is confused about the elf woman's claim, and fearful that others will persue her also.
