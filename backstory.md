My parents were Lord and Lady Whiteridge of Aramoor. My boyhood home was Harindel Castle, the seat of power in Aramoor, a spartan fortress with a war-torn history of some eight hundreds years. My brother Robert, three years my elder, was first-in-line to the throne. Before marrying my father, my mother Catherine was heiress to Cormyr, our neighbor to the South. I tell you all of this not to boast of my noble heritage. In truth my heritage is something I'd sooner you knew nothing about. However these facts are important to the story which follows.

Though it is true we were born with silver spoons in our mouths, I like to think that my parents did a fair job at keeping my brother and I humble. Each night a castle hand's family would sup with us. My father and mother would  listen intently to their stories, aspirations, and woes. And every few tendays my father would lend my brother and I out to the stable-master, blacksmith, or whoever was in need, to clean stables or linens, to work the bellows or plow fields. Nevertheless, while my brother and I returned to hearth warmed bedrooms and rested our heads on feathered pillows, the blacksmith's son returned to a small flea filled cot on a cold dirt floor. Our hands were occasionally dirtied, but we were nobles nonetheless.

My mother, was warm and gentle. She was a daydreamer and an absent-minded hummer. In the summer she would work in the garden. In winter she sat at the fire and read. In my youth I remember her as happy and carefree. But she seemed to grow more absent, frail, and aloof as time went on. 

 My father, James, was practical and stern. Although his eyes would glisten impishly when he told jokes, which he often did. He taught us to ride and shoot a bow, and daily occurrences, no matter how small, somehow always contained a life lesson for him to impart. His duties as Lord Aramoor frequently required that he traveled aways. Diplomacy is best done face to face, my father always said. In his stead the Grand Advisor Luther Proditione oversaw the day to day affairs, my mother having no interest in such matters.

It was after return from a long trip that my father fell ill.

My brother was perfect.
I was the opposite.
You'd think such different people would hate one another, but that couldn't be further from the truth.
