## Backstory
### Provenance
My parents were Lord and Lady Whitteridge of Aramoor. My boyhood home was Harindel Castle, the seat of power in Aramoor, a spartan fortress with a war-torn history of some eight hundreds years. My brother Robert, three years my elder, was first in line to the throne. Before marrying my father, my mother Catherine was heiress to Cormyr, our neighbor to the South. I tell you all of this not to boast of my noble heritage; in truth, my heritage is something I'd sooner you knew nothing about. However, these facts are essential to the story I'm about to tell you.

Though it is true we were born with silver spoons in our mouths, I like to think that my parents did a fair job at keeping my brother and me humble. Each night a castle hand's family would sup with us. My father and mother would  listen intently to their stories, aspirations, and woes. And every few tendays my father would lend my brother and me out to the stable-master, blacksmith, or whoever was in need. We would clean stables and linens, work bellows, and plow fields. Nevertheless, my brother and I returned to hearth-warmed bedrooms and rested our heads on feathered pillows while the blacksmith's son went home to a small flea-filled cot on a cold dirt floor.

My mother was warm and gentle. She was a daydreamer and an absent-minded hummer. In the summer she worked in the garden. In winter she sat by the fire and read. During my youth I remember her as happy and carefree, but as I grew older, she became anxious and frail. Still, I miss her dearly.

My father James was a practical man. He was generally serious, though his eyes would glisten impishly when he told a joke. He taught us to ride and shoot. Daily occurrences, no matter how trivial, somehow always contained a life lesson for him to impart. I miss him dearly also.

### Ouroboros
My father's duties as Lord Aramoor required that he travel frequently. "Diplomacy is best done face to face," my father would say. In his stead, Grand Advisor Luther Proditione oversaw the day-to-day affairs (my mother had no interested in governance). Luther was tall, pale, black haired, and possessed a large beak of a nose. He generally donned billowing black robes, leading Rob to joke that Luther was a crow stuck in a man's body. Even his voice seemed to *caw* a little when he was upset.

It was not long after returning from one lengthy diplomatic mission that my father fell ill. The castle phÿsik treated him for the Grey Waste, a disease of the blood that slowly eats away at its victim until he is but skin and bone. When his condition did not improve, Advisor Luther brought in apôthics and witch doctors in a desperate attempt to rid my father of the disease. It did not help. The day after my 10th birthday, following several months of struggle, my father succumbed to his illness.

Just one tenday before my father's death, my sister Henrietta was born. To this day I feel a great sadness about the circumstances of her birth. We were all burdened with the emotions that accompany the loss of a loved one, and my mother, warm and gentle in my youth, now walked about as though half asleep. In spite of this, Henrietta grew to become bright and lovely. Later when Robert was away at war, I spent many hours with Henrietta, listening to her tell fanciful stories and ponder aloud whether rain clouds feared the sun.

After my father's death Rob was the Lord of Aramoor. Advisor Luther, however, would serve as Lord Steward until Rob came of age at seventeen. 

### Brotherhood
As noble children, we were expected to be educated in history, rhetoric, arithmetic, and the many customs of the lands we governed as well as those of our neighbors. Furthermore, we were trained to use sword and shield as well as military tactics and strategy. My brothered excelled at all of this, while I only excelled at exasperating our tutors and getting myself (and my brother if I could manage it) into trouble. In fact, Robert was quite the golden boy; handsome, charming, intelligent, and kind. I was fully the opposite; stubborn, mischievous, and only charming when I wanted something.

You would think, being such different people, that my brother and I would loathe each other. But this couldn't be further from the truth. We were the best of friends, ever companions, co-conspirators, competitors, and each other's respite on dark days. Even the inevitable tiffs that all siblings have never lasted us more than a few hours, maybe a day. My brother looked out for me and I tried my best to bring levity and adventure to our lives as he navigated the pressures and burdens of being a future Lord.   

### Rebellion
As we grew older and more world-wise, tension began to rise between Luther and us. Many of Luther's policy decisions seemed to us unjust. He imposed increases in the crop yields forfeit to the crown; tariffs on any and all exports that could aid "the enemy"; nighttime curfews and the abolishment of the symbols of certain deities. We watched as our friends, millers, cobblers, farmers, and more struggled to put food on the table or were run out of town because of their religion. But Luther, with the support of our mother, insisted that we were simply too filled with youthful idealism to understand the nuances and sacrifices necessary for good governance.

When we were younger, I would concoct schemes for my brother and me to perform. We would swipe pastries from the kitchen or sneak out of the castle to watch the mummer's show. Little things that would give my brother a laugh and me a thrill. Generally these plans involved my brother sweet-talking some poor cook or butler while I did the dirty work of snagging keys or hot pans.  

As Luther's rule grew, in my view, more tyrannical, my schemes began to take on a more serious nature. If Luther regulated mead, then I would smuggle it. If he overtaxed the fiefdoms then I would arrange for the Collectors to meet a dozen swords on the road. Any opportunity to undermine Luther I fostered in secret. At one point my operations became quite extravagant and I was  breaking bread with thieves and criminals like they were old friends. Robert, for his part, was willing to overlook my subversions, so long as they were directed toward the greater good. But as age seventeen drew nearer and his responsibilities increased he was unwilling to aid me and felt uncomfortable with the breadth of my activities. 

The war came when the Northern fiefdoms rebelled. Supplies and men were sent to the front lines, and on Robert's seventeenth birthday, he went with them. Back home we waited anxiously for news as food rations and lamp oil grew scarce. As young men were killed more were sent North, and soon the small city surrounding the castle consisted mostly of women, children, the elderly, and those who found ways to escape the law.

I grew restless in Robert's absence. I immersed myself in activity that I'm not proud of. Brothels, gambling, criminal schemes that had no noble sanction. I was frustrated with Luther and my mother, frustrated that I could not join my brother till I came of age, frustrated as my friends and neighbors died at the hands of a distant enemy. And I dealt with it all by drinking and stealing and brawling with anyone who looked at me the wrong way. Healthy and mature... I know.

### Hamartia
By the time I was of an age to join the war, roughtly a year and a half after it had started, the conflict was drawing to an end. Our side would be victorious. In typical Robert fashion, my brother came home a decorated war hero, with stories of cunning and valor on the lips of commoners that I do not doubt are true. 

I remember looking at Robert after his return and being taken by how much he had changed. The person before me was fully a man. He looked every bit the Lord and war hero that he was. And I too had changed, though in different ways. I think we both could sense it, the difference, the broad expanse of experience and outlook which hung between us. But we did our best to ignore it and continued almost as though our boyhood had gone uninterrupted.

I have made many mistakes in my life. But one eclipses the rest. In my criminal misdeeds throughout the war I would occasionally sneak my accomplices into the castle for lavish food and drink after a successful heist or ploy. Somehow, it simply never occurred to me the risk I put my family in by revealing hidden entrances to the castle. To my horror, this knowledge would be put to malicious use.

Though we were victorious in the war, political unrest continued to eat away at the realm. Domestically, a group known as the Red Dawn began orchestrating demonstrations in the streets. They strung effigies of Robert and Luther from trees and would beat or burn them. They clashed with the city watch and nighttime riots became a frequent occurrence. Months prior, after Robert's return, I had withdrawn my contact with the underground. Now I looked on helplessly as the turmoil unfolded. 

In the dead of night, two days before Midwinter, the castle was infiltrated. I awoke from one nightmare into another. There were cries from the hall and a clash of metal. I sprung into the hallway, barely clothed, with nothing but a letter opener to arm me. I heard Robert emerge from his bedroom on my right just as a cloaked figure appeared in the hallway before us. The figure raised a crossbow and I didn't have  time to think before Robert pushed me away. I heard the soft *woosh* of a crossbow bolt, a hollow *thud*. Robert fell. I saw red. I rushed the figure as he attempted to reload. Too late for him. Using the letter opener I had clenched in my hand I stabbed into his throat, his face and eyes, his chest. I beat at him until blood was pooled all around us. When I regained some sense, I went to Robert's side. The bolt had gone through his heart. His face stared blankly at the ceiling. He was gone.

The guards eventually regained control of the castle and killed or captured the intruders. Nine in total, each carrying the symbol of the Red Dawn and armed in a manner that spoke of an intent to murder rather than rob. I recognized some of them. Men I had shared laughter and drinks with. This was my doing. 

### Exile
Young Henrietta, only seven, was rushed to the phÿsik for minor wounds to her arms and legs from fighting off an assailant. Assured that the danger was at a pause, I rushed to Lord Advisor's chambers. He was surrounded by two guard captains and another bald, robed man who I did not recognize. 

"I know where they gained entry to the castle. You need to post guards there immediately!" I gasped.

"Tell me." said Luther.

The two guard captains left to secure the hidden entrances after I explained their location. A few moments of silence passed before Luther signaled for the third man to leave as well. Luther stared at me, his brow furrowed.

"How did you know of this?" Luther said softly, eyes fixed on me.

"I've used the entrances in the past."

"Did you ever show anyone? Anyone from outside the castle?"

"...yes."

"Did you know those men?!" he spat.

"Some of them..." I choked back tears.

The room seemed to grow cold. Luther looked like a snake coiled to strike me. After a long pause, he spoke to me in a slow, careful whisper,

"Your mother is dead. Add her to the tally of people you've killed tonight." 

The air left of me. He continued after a few long breaths.

"By law, you are now Lord of Aramoor. But by law you are also responsible for the death of the previous Lord Aramoor, Lady Aramoor, and countless others! You granted murderers and traitors access to the castle! The punishment for regicide is death..." Luther was shaking with cold fury. 

I was lost for words.

Luther continued,

"There is little I can do for you. Legally, matters involving the deeds of the nobility are dealt with by the high court and I can only give them council..." 

A long pause. 

"...you must leave, Niko. All I can do for you is give you time. And not much of it. You must travel swiftly away from here and never return." For a brief moment he looked tired. His eyes left me for the first time since I'd entered. Slowly, he turned away.

"Go, Niko. Now."

And I did.

### Wanderer
I did not leave out of fear of execution or imprisonment, not entirely. No, what was worse for me was the thought of *becoming* Lord of Aramoor. What a joke for me to stand where my brother stood, his blood on my hands. I am not half the man my brother or father were. I am neither worthy nor willing to fill those shoes. Luther was right about me. I did not have what it took to govern. In my arrogance and naive idealism I had only reaped calamity.

And so when I left Harindel and then Aramoor, I did not look back. I moved from town to town until my purse grew lean. I worked where I could and stole when it was necessary. Years have passed in this manner, moving farther and farther from Aramoor. And now I am here.
