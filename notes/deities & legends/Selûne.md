### Leathered Journal
The journal appeared to be the records of a Lunatic leader from before the Scattering, who would only sign his entries with the name “Moonlit”.  The last surviving recording in the journal details a great battle on the plains of Nurendor (from the first age) between the Lunatics and a host of Shar’s minions from the deeps.  Moonlit describes the opposing forces as wicked, twisted beings, all but blind during the day but fearsome in the dark.

The battles were hard-fought, but Selune’s people eventually found victory by locating the daytime hiding places of Shar’s minions and forcing them to fight in the light.  What Moonlit described next is a phenomenon that no living being has experienced.  After the lunatics slaughtered the dark creatures of Shar, they prepared a celebration to take place that very night, for it was to be the rising of a new full moon, but night never came.  For 3 days and nights there would be no darkness and no moonlight.  The Lunatics fell to despair, the weakest of them, taking this as a sign that they had been abandoned, forgot their oaths and left the cause.

By the end of the fourth day, Moonlit’s forces were scattered – some having abandoned their charge, others having returned to their home temples for guidance – but, finally, there was dark.  Though this night would last all but 2 hours, Moonlit and his Lunatics rejoiced.  Over the next few entries, Moonlit describes how the night and the moon gradually returned over the next few days and begins to remark on the strangeness of it all.  Moonlit mentions that one of the elder Lunatics has a farfetched theory to explain the phenomenon but the rest of the pages of the journal have been torn out.
