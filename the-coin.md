## The Coin
The story of how I came across my magical coin is an amusing one. I discovered it after winning at a game of cards while waiting for a ship in the port at Nilrennas. It was a low stakes game. My opponent, a man who'd set up a wobbly little table and stools on the street corner, was ragged and had little to his name. And I must admit I wasn't exactly flush either. 

I walked away after winning a few hands. One gold piece, two silver, a dozen or so copper, and a marble where my prize. Not amazing, but it would feed me for a while. Only, not a hundred paces away and I realized the gold coin was missing...

Now, most people would probably assume that they had been the victim of a pickpocket. A reasonable assumption. But having skill at pickpocketing myself I'm damn good at keeping an eye on my purse. Either I was in the midst of a thief savant or something even more interesting was afoot. 

The next day I returned to play the man at cards again. I was surprised to find that he found the funds to continue playing after I'd cleaned him out. I told him, laughing, that I'd gotten drunk the night before and lost the gold coin I'd won previously. I was determined, I told him to get my winnings back! A barely noticeable smile crossed his face, for just an instance.

I won again, and this time walked away with a fair bit more as I took no mercy on this man. Hoping to bait the potential thief savant, or what-have-you, I loudly boasted of my winnings. As I walked away, I kept my hand firmly wrapped around the coin in my pocked. And I'll be damned but it disappeared right out of my hand. Not pulled, not snatched up, DISAPPEARED! Into thin air.

As I walked away I showed no sign that I'd noticed.

Here I had it figured out how the card player had filled his purse again. With a golden coin that you could summon back at your command, you could simply ask any vendor for change when paying with a the coin and make your self a pretty profit. If you were smart to never use the ploy twice in the same area, you could bankroll yourself for life. This, was a powerful little coin... and I knew that I had to have it.

The question is, how do you steal a coin when the owner can simply summon it back to themselves? With half a week before my ship to the Sapphire Shore came to port I had plenty of time to figure it out.

### **Step one.** Determine the range of the item's magic.
Nearly all magic has a limit to how far its effects can reach. A magical trinket such as this, with no source of power to draw on, surely couldn't have a range more than a couple dozen feet, I figured. So, I posted outside the card player's stand and watched him carefully. The pattern was the same nearly every time. The victim of the card player's ploy would drop the coin in her purse and begin to walk away. The player would keep an eye on them and when the victim was some fifteen or so feet off, his wrist would slightly flick and a sly smile would cross his face.

### **Step two.** Misdirection.
After receiving the coin, you must nimbly switch it with another. Keep the decoy coin in sight so the card player knows he cannot summon it yet. Meanwhile, pass the real coin to your co-conspirator to take out of range. Street urchins are perfect for this as he can slip under the table. Just make sure to offer the urchin at least double what the coin is worth to ensure he is not tempted to run off with the coin.

### **Step three.** Walk away.
Of course, it's not as quite simple as that. You see, once you've stepped out of range and the summoning hasn't work, the card player will likely chase after you to get in range. To avoid the chase, make sure his bootlaces are tied together before you go. Again, a street urchin is perfect for this. When you hear the player stumble, that is your queue to run.
